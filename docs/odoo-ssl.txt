At first Boot Odoo will be available to you at your IP Address or Associatied Domain Name.  If specified as HTTP, it will redirect to HTTPS (SSL) mode.  SSL mode in the default Turnkey Application system is "Secure" but it is not domain associated.  This means that no one can read the file as it travels through the internet until it reaches your browser.  However, you will need to "accept" the "unsecure website" warnings that the various browsers you may be using will throw up. 

Your Odoo site works with what is called a Apache Reverse Proxy.  If you are having troubles with your SSL it is possible to "open" Odoo to "non http" with some ease (see Readme.rst on Github.com at:  https://github.com/l-arnold/tkl-nomadic-odoo/blob/dev-wip1/README.rst   Bypassing SSL for your initial setup may speed you through some of your setup tasks.

When you move close to "production" or even if you know you will get there soon, we recomend you install a fully secure SSL Certificate.  Installation of a a SSL Cert installation are quite staight forward.  I recomend that most of the work be done withing the "Webmin" interface, however, some of the work is best done in the WebShell (port 12320) interface or in SSH mode through a SSH Client.  

Tools to equip yourself with.  Browsers:  Ideally Chrome + (Internet Explorer or Firefox) the later equipped with JAVA installed if you are going to use the WebMin FILEMANAGER interface.  You can avoid this if you use a SSH Client plus a SFTP Client (I recomend the BitVise SSH + SFTP Client).

SSL will need to be applied to your Port 443 which you can access wihin Webmin under APACHE WEB SERVER.

A good outline of how to Install a Cert on Turnkey systems is available at this Link:
http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/ssl-certificates

You will want first to Log into Webshell or the SSH and generate a CSR replacing "www_domain_com" with the name you want to generate a CSR for.  You will also want to input Your actual company name after the = sign.

Enter the Following: 

  openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -out www_domain_com.csr -keyout www_domain_com.key -subj "/C=US/ST=Colorado/L=Boulder/O=Your Comapny Inc./CN=www.domain.com"

Next you will want to actually Purchase a SSL Certificate.  There are many providers of certificates and there is a wide range of prices you may pay for them.  Some of the more expensive ones are technically "more telling" about your company.  They also will add difficulty to the setup.  I recomend you start with a $10 to $15 variety "Domain Certified" one to start.  You can purchase fancier ones at any point you choose in the future.  You MAY be able to even upgrade. (Contact Landis Arnold, larnold@nomadic.net or on my website at www.nomadic.net  if you would like help in this regard).

Absolutely you will want to Align all of your DNS (Domain Name Service) registration to the PUBLIC IP address your server will be available on.  (contact Landis Arnold, larnold@nomadic.net or on my website at www.nomadic.net if you would like help in this regard).

Installation instructions for aquiring the certificate will come from the provider.  You want to specify OpenSSL/Apache variety when you order.

Once you hae your package you will want to install the full set of Keys, Certs, INTCA Certs etc into a directory.  I prefer to load these Certs in a new folder inside /etc/ssl/  on my servers (IE /etc/ssl/domain_cert_folder - used here for explanation)  I use a shorter name like "nomadic.net" my domain name for my folder ie /etc/ssl/nomadic_net/.

Proceed in Webmin to Apache Web Server
Choose First the "GLOBE" icon next to Virtual Server on Port 443 (Standard https/ssl port)

Then Choose "Edit Directives"

Hav the First Lines of your Directives Read in the Form: (subsituting the name you gave to your cert for www_domain_com) (adding lines after SSL Engine On)
  SSLEngine on
  SSLCertificateFile  /etc/ssl/domain_cert_folder_com/www_domain_com.cert
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/domain_cert_folder_com/www_domain_com.key
  SSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/domain_cert_com/www_domain_com_intca.cert
  
Copy those Lines and also go to other SSL Served Folder in your Apache Directory and paste the same information at the to of the "edit directives" opened file.
Virtual Directory Serving 12324
Virtual Directory Serving 12322

So again
  After SSLEngine on
      SSLCertificateFile  /etc/ssl/domain_cert_folder_com/www_domain_com.cert
      SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/domain_cert_folder_com/www_domain_com.key
      SSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/domain_cert_com/www_domain_com_intca.cert
      
We will add subsequent information on how to also apply the Cert to Ports
  Webmin on   12321
  Webshell on 12320
  
Functionally only you and your co-workers will go to 13321 and 12320 so you can also effectively use them as "Insecure Sites" that you proceeed through "Advanced" to go to the site.  HTTPS will be crossed out if the Cert attached is not "correct".

When all finished choose:
Apply Changes.
You may also want to RESTART your Apache WebServer.

You can do all that within Webmin and there are other ways in WebShell as well.

Idally you now have a Full Cert applied to your Odoo Installation as well as the corrolarry WebConsole which is effectively just a shortcut page to get to the different parts of your full Turnkey Odoo Server.
